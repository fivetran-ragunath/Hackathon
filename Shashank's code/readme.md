Setup form generator:

With the help of this script, you may create setup forms with minimal user input.

Your system has Python 3.9 or a later version installed.

Instructions:

1. Install requests, svgwrite, pillow, io, and json libraries for Python.

`pip install requests`

2. Run the script.

3. It will ask for the location of the json file as input; provide that information or leave it blank; if empty, it will start asking for other input fields; provide the necessary information.

4. Your file will generate itself.

Notes: If the favicon is missing from the source url, an error may appear for the svg file. In that situation, you must manually retrieve the svg file.
